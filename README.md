# GherkinTestCaseExamples

## Scope

This repository contains only documentation, not runnable tests. The `.feature` files under `src/test/resources/GherkinTestCaseExamples/` are meant to demonstrate how to define a test case in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/). These example test cases are not meant to demonstrate a complete set of tests to be defined or executed for any  feature.

The repository file structure is meant to reflect a typical Cucumber project, where step definitions and support code for the `.feature` files would be developed under `src/test/java/GherkinTestCaseExamples/`.

## Application Under Test

The example application under test is [GitHub](https://github.com/), a developer platform that is widely known to software engineers.
